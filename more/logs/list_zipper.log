INFO:list_zipper:The output file name is hardcoded and appears TWO TIMES in the script.
INFO:list_zipper:This is a bad practice.
INFO:list_zipper:Instead, we should set a variable just ONCE, and use the variable as needed.
INFO:list_zipper:TODO: Edit the script to add a variable named outfile to hold the output file name.
INFO:list_zipper:TODO: Edit the code in two places to use the variable instead of the hardcoded name.
WARNING:list_zipper:Be careful. Indentation, spelling, and capitalization matter in Python.
